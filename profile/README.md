SkuldOS is a Next Generation Modern OS.
It is also a template for learning the principles of operating systems.

SkuldOS is scheduled to take ten years to complete the core code (2023-2033).
A large number of industry standard references will be collected in the process.
And a large number of sub-projects related to OS development will be incubated.
